# Refuel calculation

As already stated in the project description, this is just a little playground for testing out stuff in Angular.

## What does it do?

Have you ever wondered if it is worth taking a detour for refuelling your car or motorbike? Normally you have two or three fuel stations on your way to/from work and the prices differ just a little bit.
But is it worth putting in two extra kilometers to refuel at the station that has a slightly lower price? This calculator gives you a rough estimation how much you could save comparing the total costs of refuelling between two stations. Including what the addition distance will cost you.

# Environment

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
